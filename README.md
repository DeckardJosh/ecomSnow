<p>This is a project designed to showcase my skills as a developer. It is a mock ecommerce site for snowboarding and skiing. It uses real data pulled from sites such as Burton, Salomon, K2, ThirtyTwo, Forum and more. I plan on making this responsive, and hosting this site soon!</p>
<p><strong>Things to note:</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges was attempting actual project images. As it stands now, There is one photo being used for all of the products, and I need to do more research to updating the API rendring images based on their values.</p>
<p>There were some aspects that I had to do a bunch of research on, including useEffect, as it was not something I learned in school. I am unsure if I implemented this process correctly.</p>
<p>I decided not to implement Shopify, or any shopping cart purchase API, this is partly because the site is not live yet there isnt a point, nor do I actually want people to purchase anything.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>I used React, Redux, NodeJS, MongoDB, and some traditional JS and CSS.</p>
<p>I also leveraged Bootstrap to speed up the process for a portion of the design.</p>

<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>This project was designed off an idea of what a smaller Ecommerce website would look like. I chose a traditional home page design, such as a hero, an about section, and a quick description of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Pages:</strong></p>
<p>There are 5 seperate pages for this project. Home, Products, ProductDetails, Cart, and an Admin page for maniuplating the backend api for full customization of products.</p>

<p><strong>Home:</strong></p>
<p>The Home page is interesting through a quick scrolling text animation and some curvy designs. I have still not settled on a color scheme, as no matter what I decide on I can't help but think I could do better.</p>

<p><strong>Products:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of all the products in the database. There is a filters tab, where you can maniuplate the products shown, from age to price range to what brand it is. </p>
<p>The onclick event for clicking one of these products takes you to the products details page.</p>

<p><strong>Product Details:</strong></p>
<p>This page takes the specific data from the item clicked, and gives a bit more. The sizes are now selectable options you can click, and upon clicking add to cart, the product is added to a redux state that is shown and manipulated through the Cart page.</p>

<p><strong>Cart:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of all the cart items, and you can remove or checkout.</p>

<p><strong>Admin:</strong></p>
<p>Here is where if auth is set up, the owner of the website or store could add or remove products, update the details of the product, and much more. This is important in allowing the user full access and removing some of the compliation when contracting out a website to be built.</p>

<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>This project was fun and frustrating at the same time. Working with the filters was simple yet so complicated. I am still unsure if I preformed the actions within this in the best way possible. Furthermore, It had been a bit since I worked with Redux, but that proved to be fun and simple. As for setting up the backend and frontend, once I got in the groove i was unstoppable. Yes I probably could have used some tradtional react concepts such as reusing components on the front end, like the forms, but the goal for the backend/api and the frontend rendering was not to be perfect, rather showcase I understand how to work and maniplate API data on both sides of development. Overall, this project turned out to be very fruitful and I look forward to coming back with future updates to make it even better.</p>
